# Multi-Mode Collaborative Editor Suite (Markdown, Rich Text, Code) in Next.js

## 1. Purpose & Background

This project aims to deliver a modern, web-based editor suite with three distinct modes:

- **Markdown Editor**: Live preview and word count
- **Collaborative Rich Text Editor**: Real-time, multi-user editing with presence and cursors
- **Code Editor**: code editing with syntax highlighting

Each editor will be accessible via a dedicated route in a Next.js application. The collaborative editors will leverage proven libraries (e.g., TipTap/ProseMirror, CodeMirror, Yjs, Liveblocks) to ensure seamless real-time experience. The project will serve as a robust, extensible base for hackathons, demos, or as a foundation for more advanced collaborative platforms.

## 2. Objectives & Goals

- Deliver three fully functional editors, each with a clear, intuitive UI
- Enable real-time collaboration for rich text and code editors
- Ensure all editors are performant, accessible, and mobile-friendly
- Provide a clean, well-documented codebase with clear README and developer guides
- Use a modern, scalable tech stack (React, Next.js, TypeScript, Liveblocks/Yjs, etc.)

## 3. User Personas

- **Solo Creators**: Writers, students, or developers using the markdown or code editor for personal projects
- **Collaborators**: Teams or pairs working together in real-time on documents or code snippets
- **Hackathon Judges**: Reviewing the app for UX, code quality, and technical depth

## 4. Features & Requirements

### 4.1. Markdown Editor (/editor)

- Markdown input with live preview
- Real-time word and character count
- Responsive design
- Export/download markdown and HTML
- Theme support (light/dark)

### 4.2. Collaborative Rich Text Editor (/collab-editor)

- Real-time, multi-user editing (Google Docs-style)
- Presence indicators and live cursors
- Basic rich text formatting (bold, italic, headings, lists, links)
- User avatars/colors for collaborators
- Optional: Comments, track changes, version history

### 4.3. Code Editor (/code-editor)

- Syntax highlighting for multiple languages
- Basic code editing features
- Export/download code
- Future Features:
  - Linting and error highlighting
  - Code formatting
  - Collaborative editing capabilities

### 4.4. General

- Clean, accessible UI
- Clear navigation between editor modes
- Error handling and loading states
- Comprehensive README and developer documentation

## 5. Technical Requirements

- **Frontend**: React (with Next.js, App Router), TypeScript
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Liveblocks or Yjs (with appropriate bindings for TipTap/ProseMirror)
- **Rich Text Editor**: TipTap (ProseMirror-based)
- **Code Editor**: CodeMirror 6 (@uiw/react-codemirror)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS or CSS Modules
- **Hosting**: Vercel, Netlify, or similar
- **State Management**: React Context or Zustand (if needed)

## 6. Success Metrics

- All three editors are fully functional and bug-free
- Real-time collaboration works smoothly with multiple users
- UI is responsive and accessible
- Codebase is clean, modular, and well-documented
- README includes setup, usage, and contribution guidelines

## 7. Risks & Mitigations

- **Real-time sync issues**: Use well-supported libraries (Liveblocks/Yjs)
- **Editor performance**: Optimize rendering, debounce updates
- **Collaboration edge cases**: Test with multiple users/sessions
- **Time constraints**: Focus on core features before enhancements

## 8. Out of Scope

- Backend storage of documents (beyond real-time session)
- Advanced code features (e.g., full IDE, debugging)
- Mobile app (web only)
- Authentication system
- Testing infrastructure
